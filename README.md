# Transformer-CNN_PPG-to-ECG-and-ABP


This project predicts **ECG** and **ABP** waveforms from a **PPG** signal using a shared Transformer encoder and two CNN decoders.

## Dataset
- **PulseDB**: [Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.1090854/full)

## Model Overview
- **Shared Transformer Encoder** processes the PPG signal.
- **Two CNN Decoders**:  
  - One for ECG output  
  - One for ABP output  
- **Weighted Parameter**: Learns the balance between decoders during training.
- **Loss Functions**:  
  - **ABP**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - **ECG**: Weighted loss (R-peak locations weighted Ã—10 for better peak capture)

## Training
- `Train_model.py` handles dataset loading, preprocessing, model compilation, and training.
- Model architecture is defined separately for modularity.
